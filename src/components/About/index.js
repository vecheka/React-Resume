            My name is Vecheka (say Ve-check-ah). I was born and raised in Cambodia, and moved to the US to pursue higher education back in 2015.
            My journey here has been full of obstacles and challenges but I learned, grew, and most importantly I enjoyed every bit of it. Like they say
            <span className={classes.italic} > "Change is the only constant in life". </span> As an engineer, I enjoy solving hard problems and learning new technologies as well writing
            softwares that make people's lives easy. I have experienced with many different programmming languages, and I am also a quick learner, and love to get things done.

            <br/><br/>
            I am currently working as a software engineer in a network team at Nordstrom. I write automations to help network engineers with automationg network devices across all Nordstrom's stores, and network tools
            for troubleshooting use on the networks. Check out my <span>resume</span> to learn more about what I do.

            I like to keep my brain active and continue to learn new things all the time but at the same time, I have to give my body the same attention. I enjoy going to the gym and going hiking around Washington
            with my friends during the Summer weekends. I am also a big road trip lover, I usually plan a big road trip around the US during the summer with a friend or by myself. The scenic around the US is
            one of the best in the world if not the best. I dislike the rain and Winter season.
